        <p> Avalanche is a game I am making for Android. I've been working on it for a while and it's what got me into coding. Before I started on this app, I had never really coded before. I work on it whenever I have free time and will be finishing it up soon! I am very proud with how it's turned out so far and it was a very good learning tool.</p>

        </div>
        <p> Ever since I was little I've made and played music. I first taught myself how to play piano and then I learned Guitar. Since then, I've learned a lot more instruments and gotten a lot better at playing them. I make sure that I play an instrument every single day. Doing that will help me progress at all the instruments I know, even if it's for a short amount of time. Not only do I play music, but I also make it. Recording is a total different hobby that I enjoy just as much as playing. When I first started playing, I played a lot of classic rock, rock, and metal. Once I learned how to make and record music, I've put out a lot of instrumentals (music with no words). Instrumentals are very interesting to me. They have to be interesting and unique all without any lyrics. It's a lot harder getting someone to enjoy a song that is only music, no singing. I studied and practiced making songs very creative and became obsessed with instrumentals. I love all kinds of music though, and I create anything that is on my mind. My music is me.</p>

        <p> This is actually the website you are on right now. That messes with your head doesn't it? I've only got this one project for Road to Hire right now, but once I have more I'll probably have a project folder with all the projects in it to declutter my main page.</p>

          <h2 class="projectName">Miscellaneous</h2>
        </div>
        <p> There is nothing out of the ordinary with my miscellaneous folder. It is exactly what you think it is. One thing inside that I really like is the "inspiration" folder. It has pictures, files, quotes, anything that I find inspiring. Any time I need a new idea for something or just need to get remotivated, I know I can come to this folder and the get ideas or tips that i'm looking for.</p>
