            <p id="bioText">Hello, my name is Parker Shelton, if you didn't know already. I am twenty going on fifty and I'm the luckiest man on Earth. Not only have I somehow survived twenty years, I have the most amazing, gorgeous wife in the world. I also have a 3 month old beautiful baby daughter, who is the reason I'm here. She's my motivation for everything I do, I wan't to give her the world. I plan on doing that by getting a job as a computer engineer. Coding has always been one of my favorite hobbies so if I can get paid to do what I love then I can make a lot of money and I'll be happy. Honestly, I'd rather be a rock star touring the world playing my guitar and showing everyone my musical talents... but that is a little far fetched so I think I'll stick to coding. Along with making music and coding, I really love to draw. I mostly draw in pencil, realistic and unrealistic, but I've had some experience painting too. I have a tablet that lets me draw onto my TV so I love making digital paintings. The thing I love the most about digital art is that it can be used along with coding. I can make things work and make them look good at the same time. Basically, creativity is who I am. The things I create are my feelings, emotions, troubles put in a way that I feel comfortable with. I'm antisocial and can't express myself through words very well, so I use my creativity to show who I really am.</p>
